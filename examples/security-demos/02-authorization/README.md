# Security example #2: Authorization

This is the 2nd example in the series on Spring Security.

This example shows how we can configure:

1. Different authorization levels for different URLs: /admin only for admins, /user only for authorized users, / for
   anyone.
2. We also include all the functionality from the [first example](../01-in-memory-authentication): static in-memory users, login and logout forms

The code is based on the video
["How to configure Spring Security Authorization" by Java Brains](https://youtu.be/payxWrmF_0k).
